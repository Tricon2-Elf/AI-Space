# AI-Space
 
## Purpose

The purpose of this repo is to create a central repository of anything AI Sp@ce related from file formats to protocols if possible.


- Scripts: Contains a number of Python scripts for converting AI Sp@ce specific formats into more modern formats like converting DXG->GLTF and DSS->PNG and so on.
- OldTools: Contains a number of tools in Java and Ruby that I have found over the last few months from previous efforts
- Documentation: Contains what documentation I have been able to find over the last few months to help with this effort.
