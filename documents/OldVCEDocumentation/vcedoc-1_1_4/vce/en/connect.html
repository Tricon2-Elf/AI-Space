<H1>Connection from VCE client 
</H1>
<P>
Judging method of success and error  
when client using VCE connecting with server 
also using the VCE is explained in the following. 
</P>
<H2>Connection method recommended</H2>
<P>It is recommended that
connection success test using only vce_conn_writable function 
and connection of non-blocking encryption in applications using VCE. 
</P>
<PRE>tcpcontext_t t = vce_tcpontext_create( 0, ... );
conn_t new_con = vce_tcpcontext_connect( t, "localhost" , 80 ); /* A */
while (1 ){
  vce_heartbeat();
  if( vce_conn_writable( new_con ) &gt;= 4 ){
    vce_conn_write( new_con, "test" , 4 ); /* write process */
  } else {
    /*  Error will be notified if fixed time passes from A. */
  }
}      
</PRE>
<P>
In case of this way, 
when vce_conn_writable does not return a positive value within fixed time 
by using some kind of timer, 
add the process to display an error on client terminal 
to notify users of unconnectable state. 
Moreover, the above method is also effective even when not using the encryption.</P>
<P>
By using "blocking connection" of VCE, some pesky procedures 
such as test programs and server monitoring programs can be omitted, 
and so you can make it easily.
When you use the "blocking connection", 
it is possible to check the connection success 
without looping, as below;
<br>
However, omitting procedures such as test programs and 
server monitoring programs is often needed to make it easily.
"Blocking connection" of VCE can be used for such a purpose.
</P>
<PRE>tcpcontext_t t = vce_tcpontext_create( 0, ... );
conn_t new_con = vce_tcpcontext_connect( t, "localhost" , 80 );
if( vce_conn_is_valid( new_con ) == 0 ){
  /* Error! Convenient, since it can judge here. */
}
while (1 ){
  vce_heartbeat();
  if( vce_conn_writable(new_con)&gt;0 ){
    /* write process */
  }
}
</PRE>
<P>
However, when you use this way, it does not work as expected, 
only when the server has reached the number of the absolute maximum connection.
Thus, the vce_conn_is_valid function returned success in the above example 
though, once it starts looping, the vce_conn_writable returns an error.
Since the server reached the maximum connection in fact, it is natural that the vce_conn_writable returns the error finally, 
but the problem is why the first vce_conn_is_valid returns success. 
</P>
<P>
This cause is operation when reaching the maximum number of the connections 
in the VCE server, since connection is once accepted and then closed 
when the number of connection from client reaches to preset maximum number.
VCE and other UNIX tools (apache etc.) have become such a spec 
because there is limitation on the function of socket libraries as follows;
</P>
<UL>
  <LI>The socket libraries of UNIX do not have any way to return "connection 
  refused" by the function of TCP/IP not having the concept of the maximum 
  connection, when some server has reached the maximum number of the connection.
  <LI>Do not repeat binding/listening or releasing the same port near 
      the maximum number of the connections. 
      Although the operation above-mentioned can execute by repeating binding, 
      listening, or releasing again and again whenever it reaches the maximum 
      connection, it will be a problem on performance besides being a security 
      hole so it is not recommended. 
 </LI></UL>
<P>
Therefore, the server applications which currently operate on UNIX, the operations once accept and then close the connection, as a default. 
</P>
<H2>How to use the maximum number of connections.</H2>
<P>
The above-explained operation is the default of connection beyond 
the maximum number of the connections in the VCE. 
However user who accesses when a server is crowded cannot know 
with this operation whether the server is crowded or is in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Thereat, the VCE sets up "temporary" number of the maximum connection 
besides the number of the absolute maximum connection and it has the function to call other connection monitoring functions when connection beyond the temporary number of the maximum connections is accepted.
The other functions are vce_tcpcontext_set_circ_hiwater_acceptwatcher and 
vce_tcpcontext_set_conn_hiwater_acceptwatcher.  For details, refer to 
the vce_tcpcontext_set_conn_hiwater_acceptwatcher function.
