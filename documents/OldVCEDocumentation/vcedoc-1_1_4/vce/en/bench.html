<h1>VCE Benchmark results</h1>

<p>
This page discusses, through a benchmark test,
what sort of performance can be produced using the VCE. 
</p>

<h2>Environment</h2>
<p>
Ethernet is inexpensive and immediately replaceable hardware.
Here, testing was performed in an environment using the most common
100Base-TX and a regular switch.
In this environment, 2 "ping -f" tests were run simultaneously and
the results were about 14000 pkt/s with a data size of 64 bytes or less.
With a data size of 100 bytes, they were 5100 pkt/s;
with 1000 bytes, they were about 1200 pkt/s.
</p>
<BR>
<p>
Each end of "ping -f" test machines were respectively
a P3-1GHz*1 and a P3-933MHz*2.  
CPU utilization at threshold speed was stable and below 1% for both.
<BR>
</p>
<BR>
<p>
No problems with the network, machines, or test environment itself were found 
through testing.
</p>

<h2>Program Used for the Test</h2>
<pre>
autotest/nogen_sv :  Test server not using VEC (echoes back)
autotest/nogen_vecsv :  Test server using VEC (echoes back)
autotest/nogen_cl :   Client (expects an echo)
</pre>
<p>
The test measured "queries per second" (Q/s).
The test will follow following steps:
</p>
<ol>
  <LI>Start the server
  <LI>Multiple clients are connected
  <LI>Confirm clients have entered a steady state successfully
  <LI>Measure Q/s in server side
</ol>

<p>
The server echoes received data as-is,
so the ratio of the amount received to the amount sent was exactly 1:1
for this test.
In addition, attention must be paid to whether the server checks
to see if received data is arranged in correct sequence,
if the buffer contents are correct, and the like.
During 100 Mbps communication,
memory bandwidth on the order of 400 Mbps is eaten up in order to
perform this check,
so this accounts for several percent of the threshold speed.
</p>
<p>
Query size, the number of clients, the presence or absence of VEC,
and the presence or absence of encryption can significantly affect
test results, so each of the settings was changed and measured.
With regard to the number of clients, significant variation was
observed with 10 or fewer clients;
with 10 or more, this variation lessened.    
</p>

<h2>General Phenomena</h2>
<p>
When transmitting data at maximum speed using 1 session,
communication is through a "(long) fat pipe,"
so sufficient buffer size must be prepared on both the server and client side.
The band cannot be used to full advantage if this is not done.
A buffer of 1 Mbyte or more should be prepared for a session with
100 Mbps to allow smooth data transfer.
</p>


<h2>Connection</h2>
<p>
With up to about 1000 clients, experimentation with 1 client machine
per 1 server machine is possible even if no particular work is done on
kernel settings.
To do this, you will type
</p>
<pre>
limit openfiles 1024
</pre>
<p>
in your command shell.
</p>


<h2>In case of unencrypted, no Relays</h2>
<p>
The VEC is not used with the lightest contents and neither is encryption.
Encryption is not even used in part with the following connections:
</p>
<pre>
        192.168.1.0/24
 Server --- Switch ---- Client
 P3 933        |         P3 1G
               +------- Client ... (for numerous connections)

</pre>
<p>
As shown below, delayed or nodelay is written on the far right.
Generally, if NODELAY is present Q/s decreases but response improves.
When the query size is small, that difference is noticeable.
When the number of clients increases or queries are larger,
that gap shrinks.
The notation <font color=red>k Q/s</font> stands for 1000 queries per second.
</p>
<Pre>
1byte, 1 client : 21.9k Q/s (nodelay)
1byte, 1 client : 50.1k Q/s (delayed)
1byte, 16 client : 31.5k Q/s (nodelay)
1byte, 16 client : 36.6k Q/s (delayed)
1byte, 512 client : 19.9k Q/s (nodelay)
32byte, 1 client : 21.4k Q/s (nodelay)
32byte, 512 client : 19.5k Q/s (nodelay)
128byte, 128 client : 20.8k Q/s (delayed)
256byte, 16 client : 19.1k Q/s  (nodelay)
256byte, 16 client : 29.0k Q/s (delayed)
256byte, 128 client : 15.4k Q/s (delayed)
256byte, 256 client : 15.1k Q/s (delayed)
256byte, 512 client : 13.3k Q/s (delayed)
512byte, 16 client : 15.7k Q/s (nodelay)
512byte, 16 client : 18.9k Q/s (delayed)
1024byte, 16 client : 10.2k Q/s  (nodelay) It drops rapidly here (for Ether)
1100byte, 16 client : 9.2k Q/s (nodelay)
1200byte, 16 client : 8.3k Q/s (nodelay)
1400byte, 16 client : 7.2k Q/s (nodelay)
1500byte, 16 client : 6.6k Q/s (nodelay)
1700byte, 16 client : 1.4k Q/s (nodelay)
2048byte, 16 client : 2.2k Q/s (nodelay)
3000byte, 16 client : 1.6k Q/s (nodelay)
3000byte, 16 client : 2.0k Q/s (delayed)
</Pre>
<p>
In all the cases above, CPU utilization reaches almost 100% at the point
where maximum speed is put out;
the server process is waiting for I/O most of that time.
Even while waiting for I/O, the kernel (device driver) is working,
so on the part of the CPU there is almost no time in which
it can be used for other purposes. 
</p>
<p>
 After all, 50.1k Q/s is the maximum speed when no encryption and no relay.
Of course this performance will vary affected by NICs,
and the effect of NIC is also same in all following tests.
</p>

<h2>In case of using encryption</h2>
<p>

If Blowfish/64bit encryption is used with a P3 933MHz,
the Q/s below is produced regardless of the number of connections.
Q/s decreases to a large extent, though in this case most of the CPU time
is used for encryption processing.
There is almost no time to use it for other purposes.
If, for example, 3.0 k Q/s is utilized when using a 16-byte query,
50% of the CPU will be free.
</p>
<pre>
1byte,  10 client : 9.4k Q/s (delayed)
1byte,  256 client : 7.7k Q/s (delayed)
16byte,  10 client : 7.6k Q/s (delayed)
16byte,  256 client : 6.0k Q/s (delayed)
256byte,  10 client : 2.4k Q/s (delayed)
256byte,  256 client : 2.1k Q/s (delayed)
1024byte,  10 client : 741 Q/s (delayed)
2048byte,  10 client : 378 Q/s (delayed)
</pre>
<p>
It is clear looking at these results that the P3 933MHz machine has, at rough estimate, the following Blowfish encryption capability. 
<pre>
2048 * 378 * 8bit * (full duplex) = 12.3 Mbps
</pre>
</p>

<H2>In case of using relays, but no encryption</h2>
<p>
Testing measured whether speeds were enhanced using relays even when
not using encryption.
The protocol header for communications between the relay server and
actual(main) server has less than half of a TCP header,
so exceeding the previous 50.1 k Q/s is highly likely.
Here, experimentation was performed by separating networks so that
traffic between the relay server and actual server did not interfere
with client and relay server traffic.
The first test results indicated that Q/s received by the Proxy are at
most 50.1 k Q/s, so whether that value would be produced was first examined.
As a result, a value of 69.5 k Q/s was produced.
The reason the speed was faster than 50.1 k Q/s was that the algorithm of
the VCE's client search engine is simply faster
(though it does consume more memory) than the kernel's TCP/IP socket hash.
</p>
<p>
 Nextly, let's put clients in the Proxy machine.
As a result, a value of 106.9 k Q/s was produced.
This value is certain to be close to maximum speed
for a 1-byte query at 100 Mbps.
</p>

<pre>

        192.168.0.0/24            192.168.1.0/24

Server ----- Switch ----- Proxy ---- Switch ---- Client
P3 933                    P3 1G          |       P3 600*2
                                         +------ Client
                                                 P3 550
</pre>
<pre>
1byte, 1 client : 2.5k Q/s
1byte,  60 client : 69.5k Q/s
1byte,  128 client : 106.9k Q/s
16byte,  128 client : 83.0k Q/s
64byte,  128 client : 58.5k Q/s
128byte,  128 client : 30.5k Q/s
256byte,  1 client : 12.8k Q/s
256byte,  4 client : 15.5k Q/s
256byte,  16 client : 18.0k Q/s
1024byte, 8 client : 7.7 Q/s
</pre>
<p>
  If packets are larger, exceeding 256 bytes, Q/s will decrease
more than when communicating directly without using relays.
This is due to the relay server header.
However, the server's CPU usage even in this case is below 10%,
which differs from cases of no relay.
This is due to reasons such as processing with the VCE's client search
routine and performing I/O in large units.  
</p>

<h2>In case of using both relays and encryption </h2>
<p>
Finally, the case was tested when encryption of communications between
the client and relay was used.
This pattern lets the relay server display its best side.
As a result of values obtained in previous tests,
a single relay was thought to have proxy capacity of about  9 k Q/s.
Proxy - Client communications in the same network environment as used in
previous experiments were encrypted with Blowfish/8.
As a result, values of
</p>

<pre>
1byte, 10 client, 1 swp : 9.3k Q/s
1byte, 128 client, 1 swp : 9.5k Q/s
2048byte, 10 client, 1 swp : 380 Q/s
</pre>
<p>
were produced, so they are clearly according to theory for the most part.
At this stage, there was still leeway for the Server's NIC,
so another relay server was booted on the machine which the
Server was running (one P3 933MHz was excess) and linked to the
localhost Server to see if Q/s would increase directly.
Upon doing so, 19.1 k Q/s, or almost double the original value,
was attained.
</p>

<pre>
1byte, 20 client, 2 swp : 19.1k Q/s
2048byte, 20 client, 2 swp : 842 Q/s
2048byte, 30 client, 3 swp : 1260 Q/s
</pre>

<p>
If number of swp machines is increased, Q/s clearly increased linearly.
Naturally, the Server's CPU utilization at this point is below 1%;
clearly, encryption processing has been fully externalized from main server.
If there were more CPUs (machines), the maximum performance on the
Server side could be verified, but currently there are not enough machines
in our test environment (sorry about that!).
In all likelihood, having about 5 more swp machines would be acceptable
in order to achieve Q/s so as to operate the Server's NIC at full capacity.
</p>



<h2>Test with 1000Base</h2> 
<p>
Verification with 100Base was finished for the most part,
so testing with 1000Base was to be next,
but this testing will be performed after a test environment
is completed within the Community Engine.
</p>


<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
The fact that swp processing performance is 12.3 Mbps with a P3 1GHz,
that swp should certainly be used when using encryption,
and that the effects of swp when exchanging large packets without
using encryption were not that dramatic were clarified through the experiment.
In addition, the first thoughts must be about what level of Q/s
the application requires when developing applications using the VCE;
the form of swp must be designed in response.
