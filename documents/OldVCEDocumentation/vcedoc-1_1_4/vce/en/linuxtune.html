<h1>Linux Tune</h1>
<p>
 Depending on the size and contents of the service, you may need to tune Linux 
kernel to run a program using VCE on Linux older than 2.4.  This section describes how to tune TCP/IP on Linux.  </p>

<h2>The Reason why there are differences Between Linux 2.2 and 2.4 </h2>
<p>
Linux 2.4 and later versions offer a function that automatically expands 
the size of fd_set when the assigning unused fd (ex. file, socket) exceeds 
the size of fd_set within the existing kernel. 
Therefore, you do not need to tune the fd_set value in the kernel.  
Just tune at a library level.  
However, Linux 2.2 and older versions do not have the same functions.  
The size of FD_SETSIZE is fixed in kernel and the maximum fd number is 
regulated.  
This section describes how to tune kernel with the old versions of Linux. 
</p>

<a name="session"></a>
<h2>Set The Number of Session Greater Than 1000 </h2>
<p>
Most programs using VCE that handle more than 1000 connections require 
tuning other than VCE. 
This section describes how to use many file descriptor in Linux. <BR> 
VCE is compiled to handle 65536 connections.  When you develop an application 
with VCE, you can support multi-connection by tuning the kernel 
without modifying the glibc. 
</p>

<h2>For VCE Users </h2>
<p>
Linux 2.4 family kernel supports a multi-connection; 
however, you need to configure to utilize this feature.  
As a superuser, use csh shell (csh and tcsh but not bash/zsh) and 
modify the limitations as follows.   </p>
<pre>
shell # limit descriptors 10000
shell # limit openfiles 10000
</pre>
<p>
However, you do not want to run server as root privilege, 
change INR_OPEN of include/linux/fs.h of Linux kernel to 10000, for instance. 
Then general users can use this number of connection.  (Usually you do not need to change the limits; you need to do so for some shellï½“.) 
You have to choose either tuning the kernel or running the server with root. 
</p>
<p>
After handling the above, you also need to change the upper limit of the number 
of files being opened.  Use the following command line. 
</p>
<pre>
shell # echo 65536 > /proc/sys/fs/file-max
</pre>

  <LI>Problem of strace (Linux 2.4.x)<p>
	  After changing the size of include/linux/fs.h, 
          if you trace an application program with strace program, 
          select() function call is not properly displayed.  
          You need to recompile the strace program to solve this problem.</p></li>
  <LI>Amount of Memory <p>
	  The multi-connection requires lots of memory, 
          so prepare physical memory as much as possible. 
          For tens of thousands of connections, implement more than 768M memory.
      </p></li>
  <LI>Local Port Number <p>
	  If the number of connection exceeds thirty thousand, 
          the range of local port causes shortage.  
	  Use the following command line to expand the range (Linux 2.4x). <p>
          <pre>
	  shell # echo 10000 65500 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range
	  </pre><p>
	  Reducing the lower limit too much (10000 in the above example) affects          other applications.  
          For an IP single home, approximately 50000 connections are 
          the actual limit.  </p></li>
   <LI>Other Applications<p>
	  Other applications which use a select() function (including shell) 
          must be recompiled to use a multi-connection.  
          It is because most applications are compiled with a premise of 
          1024 connections.  </p></li>

<h3>For VCE Developers </h3>
<p>
The data structure of fd_set is important.  
With glibc 2.2.x, fd_set is defined as follows (retrieved by gcc -E).  
"Compiling VCE to support maximum 65536 connections" means 
making fd_set structure large enough for VCE.  
It is merely changing the defines of various headers and then making it.  
Match them to maximum values (only Linux).  The size of fd_set becomes about 8KB and it is enough for a server on Linux. 
</p>
<pre>
typedef long int __fd_mask;
typedef struct
{
  __fd_mask __fds_bits[__FD_SETSIZE / (8 * sizeof (__fd_mask))];
} fd_set;
</pre>
<p>
_FD_SETSIZE is defined in /usr/include/bits/types.h and in include/linux/posix_types.h of Linux kernel source (symlinked from libc). 
The first one is for the glibc internal, the next one is for kernel. 
Since the pointer of fd_set that is passed to kernel is a simple array, 
reserve a large area and pass it to any kernel (also applied to FreeBSD).  
Also, change INR_OPEN of fs.h likewise for usability. 
Then general users can have 65536 fds. 
</p>

<h3> In FreeBSD </h3>
<p>
FD_SETSIZE of /usr/include/sys/types.h is everything. 
</p>
<pre>
typedef unsigned long   fd_mask;
typedef struct fd_set {
    fd_mask fds_bits[((( 1024  ) + ((  (sizeof(fd_mask) * 8 )  ) - 1)) / (  (sizeof(fd_mask) * 8 )  )) ];
} fd_set;
</pre>
<p>
Change FD_SETSIZE of sys/sys/types.h in kernel source and the constant 2048 of 
sys/sys/kern/sys_generic.c, and match FD_SETSIZE of /usr/include/sys/types.h to it before compiling VCE. 
Like Linux, it is simply an array so setting a large size of fd_set with VCE 
causes no problem.  
</p>


<a name="keepalive"><h3>How to Detect a Terminated Connection of Client</h3></a><p>
When a client uses a dial-up PPP and the server is on Linux, and if a telephone line of the client side is unplugged, there is no way to detect this termination at the server side since ICMP message is not generated.  
</p>
<p>
VCE use SO_KEEPALIVE option.  With the standard setting of Linux, a KEEPALIVE 
packet is sent two hours later after a communication is lost.  
Game applications need to detect the termination in a short time.  
Therefore, you need tuning to solve this problem.  
</p>

<h3>How KEEPALIVE Packet Works </h3>
<p>
When tcp_keepalive_time seconds has elapsed after the last packet exchange, 
keepalive of TCP sends probe packet to the other end per tcp_keepalive_intvl 
seconds, and it perceives it as disconnection if it does not receive replies 
tcp_keepalive_probes times. 
With Linux 2.4, these settings can be configured for each OS 
(not for each socket).  
To manage options of keepalive, use the following three variables.  
<ul>
  <LI>/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_keepalive_probes
  <LI>/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_keepalive_time
  <LI>/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_keepalive_intvl  ( 2.4 and later) 
</ul>
See (man tcp(7)).  Configure these variables as follows. 
</p>
<p>
<pre>
echo 2 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_keepalive_probes
echo 60 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_keepalive_time
echo 60 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_keepalive_intvl
</pre>
In this example, timeout expires 60 + 2 * 60 = approximately 180 seconds 
after a connection has terminated.  
For VCE, closewatcher is called at the server side.
