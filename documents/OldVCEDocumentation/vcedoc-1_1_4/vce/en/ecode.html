<h1>VCE's Error Codes and Error Messages </h1>
<p>
There are two methods to identify an error in VCE; getting an error number by vce_get_last_error function and referring the output strings in the error log (vce_errout).  These methods are explained in below.
</p>


<h2>VCE's Error Codes</h2>
<p>
The following list contains the error codes of VCE.  New error codes may be added later, but existing ones will not be deleted nor modified.  So the following codes are valid for future versions.

<h2>VCE's Error Log Message </h2>
<p>
There are four kinds of message stored in a log by VCE: Fatal, Warning, Bug, and Note.  All messages are numbered; Fatal error messages start from 1000, Warning message starts from 4000, Bug message starts from 7000, and Note message starts from 10000.  Numbers would be increased in future version of VCE, but existing messages will not be deleted nor modified (detailed description may be changed).  The following messages are for VCEgg 0.2.  These are defined as macro by vce.h.  <BR>
Because descriptions of these messages may be changed in the future, always use the error number such as "Fatal: 1101" rather than the English description as a clue to analyze a log with backup tools and administration tools.
</p>

<h2>Fatal Error Messages </h2>
<p>
Fatal error messages are generally caused with the wrong usage of VCE by application or with insufficient configuration of the operating system (problem with port, free memory, permission problem, etc.)  An error can be solved by carefully tracking down the cause.

<h3>Warning Messages </h3>
<p>
Warning messages indicate that the exhaustion of resource or the deterioration of performance may be experienced in the future even though VCE continues working.  It is recommended to avoid warning messages as much as possible by tuning VCE's configuration.

  <LI>"Bug:7100 vecp: cannot delete search entry\n"<p>
	  Not registered with search engine that should have been registered.  
          Therefore it could not be deleted from search engine. </p></li>

  <LI>"Bug:7106 vecsv: vce_circ_close fail\n"<p>
	  Could not find a virtual circuit that should be closed inside 
          vce_circ_close function.  This error could happen when application 
          attempts to close more than twice for the same virtual circuit.  
          Otherwise, it is due to VCE's bug.  </p></li>

  <LI>"Bug:7109 state buffer is full.(accept)\n"	  <p>
	  Status management buffer is full even though connection is not full.  
          Obviously it is VCE's bug. </p></li>

  <LI>"Bug:7112 connect: statebuf shortage\n"	  <p>
	  Only status management buffer is full when vce_tcpcontext_connect was 
          called.  It is VCE's bug.  </p></li>
