<h1>VCE and Security</h1>


<p>
This document explains what kind of crackings over application
can be prevented using VCE in this document.
</p>

<H2>Packet Sniffing </h2>
<p>
By putting sniffering programs in routers or some devices between
client and server, you can do "packet sniffering" like these:
<ol>
  <li> Sucking out passwords or some information by analyzing 
       content of transferred packets.
  <li> Do reverse engineering by looking at precise transferred data.
</ol>
  You can find a lot of such sniffering tools by searching "sniffing 
tools" in Google.
</p>

<H2>Spoofing</h2>
<p>
 Spoofing is that another user is trying to reproduce the state
where the regular user has accessed the server, using another tool.

It is the even higher way using sniffing tool.

When the spoofing is possible, you can spoof the client
or freely alter transferred data are possible.
</p>

<h2>man-in-the-middle</h2>
<p>
  "man-in-the-middle attack" is 
that a third party people invades between client and  server 
to sniff and spoof.
</p>
<pre>
  Cient-------- Third party ----------- Internet ------ Server
</pre>
<p>
In this situation, if the third party has malice thoughts
, various kinds of attacks will be attained easily.

 In order to prevent this fundamentally,
an encryption key must be exchanged without using this network.
It is because the spoofing will become possible by sniffing
a packet completely,
when the encryption key is exchanged on the same network. 
</p>

<H2>man-in-the-middle for the VCE appication</h2>
<p>
In conclusion, spoofing is possible,
when the conditions below are fulfilled. 
</p>
<ul>
  <LI>A third party is possible to operate routers or network devices 
      between client and server. 
  <LI>The third party knows key exchange algorithm of the VCE.
  <LI>They can sniff all packets from the starting of session.
</ul>  
<p>
   In fact, such situations can be made from slight time and effort, 
and when reverse engineering (cheating in case of games) is the purpose, 
it is also considered that a third party is a user oneself. 
Although the encryption of the VCE can prevent "innocent" crackers,
it cannot prevent "professional" crackers. 
  However, most of actual crackings are caused by the "innocent" crackers,
and under 10% of the whole crackers is by the "professional" crackers
who prepare tools and environment.
</p>
<p>
  Now, if the encryption of the VCE is used in applications,
it will typicallyã€€consume about 10% of server CPU.
 Therefore, it is necessary to decide whether use encryption or not
by comparing the merit of security improvement by VCE encryption
with the demerit in the server CPU usage.
</P>
<p>
 Since there is not much economical merit of cracking especially in games, 
almost all the crackings can be headed off only by preventing a
"innocent" crackers. 
Therefore, VCE encryption is more beneficial,
except in a case that the 10% of server CPU load must be
reduced as the top priority.
</p>

<h2>Attack on a server </h2>
<p>
It is also possible to perform a DoS attack to the VCE. 
The SYN flood attack, or attacks to the layer of TCP/IP and lower.
But such a lower level attacks must be coped
by Linux kernel or network devices.
<BR>
The attack considered about the layer above them can be: 
<BR>
consuming a memory by opening a huge number of sessions and 
stopping packet transferring in the middle of key exchange.
<BR>
Although there is no report about this attack so far, 
we will cope with as soon as we get one.
