<h2>About VCE monitoring</h2>
<p>
VCE monitoring is unified API for supervising or operating
the activity of remote servers using VCE from remote. 
</p>
<p>
The various maintenance tools attached to VCE are constructed
using this monitoring API from now on. 
As the examples of this API,
swp and swpadm programs are attached to the VCE package.
</p>

<a name="system"></a>
<h2>System of VCE monitoring</h2>
<P>
 VCE monitoring is a simple server client system.
Basically, in monitored server side,
one tcpcontext is used and the connection from a remote is accepted.
A TCP session is opened from monitor client to server,
and a command is transmitted.
</p>
<p>
Although a command is transmitted in the form of a text,
RIJNDAEL with the key length 16 is used inside in order to achieve security. 
Moreover, the "key" for accessing a function is needed
for all command transmission.
</p>
<P>
The list of the commands given in a string is
completely in agreement with the command which can bring out
the swpadm command.
The swpadm command can birng out all the commands for monitoring. 
Refer to <a href="switch.html#swpadm">Connection Switching function guide</a>

<h2>Server initialization</h2>
<p>
In order for a monitor function to become effective,
it is necessary to start a monitor server by the server side first.
A vce_monitor_server_enable function is used for it. 
Moreover, in order to support shutting down from remote,
a shutdown-accept function must be prepared and it registers
with a vce_monitor_server_set_shutdownwatcher function.
The following codes are virtual codes which mount this flow.  
</p>
<pre>
static void shutdown_func( void )
{
    exit(0);
}
int main()
{
  vce_initialize();
  if( vce_monitor_server_enable( PORT, MAXMON, "password" )&lt;0){
    /* error handling */
  }
  vce_monitor_server_set_shutdownwatcher( shutdown_func );
}
</pre>
<p>
In this code, it is important to define the function for a shutdown
first and to have registered it later.
When not defining a shutdown function,
you cannot use shutdown function.
In order for a shutdown not to be possible being conscious of security,
it will also be good way not to configure this function.
</p>


<a name="client"></a>
<h2>Client initialization</h2>
<p>
  The following procedures have to be completed in order to
connect from the client for watching(for example, swp)
to the server whose monitor function is configured.

</p>
<ol>
  <LI>vce_monitor_client_enable<BR>
      Call this function 
  <LI>vce_monitor_client_set_replywatcher<BR>
      Call this function with arguments
  <LI>vce_monitor_client_add<BR>
      Register a required number of monitoring hosts by function. 
  <LI>vce_monitor_client_callable<BR>
      Check whether command transmission by function is possible.
  <LI>vce_monitor_client_call<BR>
      Transmit a command by function. 
  <LI>When replywatcher is registered,
      a result can be received with the function.
</ol>      
<P>
It is as follows when the above flows are coded into a virtual code.
</p>
<pre>
int main()
{
  vce_initialize();
  if( vce_monitor_client_enable( MAXMON ) &lt; 0 ){ /* error */ }
  vce_monitor_client_set_replywatcher( repwatcher );
  monitor_ent_t ment;
  vce_monitor_ent_init( &ment, MON_HOST_ID, host, port );
  if( vce_monitor_client_add( &ment ) &lt; 0 ){ /* error */ }
  while(1){
    vce_heartbeat();
    if( sent == 0 &amp;&amp; vce_monitor_client_callable(MON_HOST_ID) &gt; 0 ){
      if( vce_monitor_client_call( MON_HOST_ID, send_string ) &gt; 0 ){
        /* ok !! */
        break;
      }
    }
  }
}
</pre>
